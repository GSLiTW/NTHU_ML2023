        "In this part, you need to implement the Naive Bayesian classifier. Since the data is categorical, you can refer to the L3-Bayesian Classifier course slides, p.12~16. The Bayes' theorem is as follows:\n",

        "$$P(C|X) = \\frac{P(X|C) \\cdot P(C)}{P(X)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "We know that taking the logarithm of a series of multiplications can be transformed into a series of additions, making it easier to calculate. So, we can formulate it as follows by taking the logarithm of both sides:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\log(P(C|X)) = \\log(P(X|C)) + \\log(P(C)) - \\log(P(X))$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The term $\\log(P(X))$ is a normalization constant that ensures the probabilities sum to 1 across all classes and is the same for all classes. Since it's constant during prediction for all classes, it doesn't affect class comparison. Therefore, in practice, you don't need to compute or include $\\log(P(X))$ explicitly when comparing classes. Instead, you can focus on the relative values of the posterior probabilities.\n",
